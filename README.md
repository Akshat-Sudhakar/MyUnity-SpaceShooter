🚀 MyUnity Space Shooter

MyUnity Space Shooter is my first ever game created using Unity (2019) and C#.
It’s a classic 2D arcade-style shooter where you pilot your spaceship through waves of enemies and asteroids — testing your reflexes, precision, and survival instincts in deep space.

🎮 Gameplay Overview

Control your spaceship using arrow keys or WASD.
Shoot lasers to destroy incoming enemies.
Avoid asteroids and enemy projectiles to stay alive.
Collect power-ups to boost your score and weapon fire rate.
The game ends when your ship takes too much damage — try to beat your high score!
